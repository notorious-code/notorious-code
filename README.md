# Hi, I'm Zura 👋

I'm a frontend developer passionate about building responsive, user-friendly, and accessible web interfaces. I focus on writing clean HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — and I'm currently working through real-world challenges to sharpen my skills.I'm also working on small freelance-style front-end orders from design communities and local businesses — these help me apply frontend skills to real-world needs.
